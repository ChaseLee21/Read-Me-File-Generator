  ## Description
  This project is a console app created for my coding bootcamp. The goal of this project is to take in user input and generate a markdown README file that could be included in a project. To accomplish this I use node.js to execute javascript outside of a browser.

  ## Installation
  Must have node installed on your machine. I used Node 20 when developing. You will also need to install inquirer which is an npm package used to recieve user input. To do that follow the usage instructions below.
  ## Usage
  To use this project you have to have Node.js installed on your machine. Download the source code and create a new folder in the root of the source code called 'export'. This export folder is where the newly generated readme.md file will be created. After that in a terminal run the command npm install to download the dependencies for the project. Once installed run the command "node index.js" in the terminal to start the app. 
  ## Contribution
  For this project I worked with two classmates Will Schickler and Shelby Hutchinson. The exact files that we worked on together are the index.js and utils/generateMarkdown.js. The code in these files are not the exact same    but just similar as we worked together via voice chat.
